          <h3>The event was made open for
                students across all batches and branches. Students worked on a project in groups of at
                most three and then presented it in the symposium- the final project display round. The
                projects were from various domains like programming, robotics, graphics designing, etc.
                The best projects were given certificates and goodies to appreciate their efforts and encourage them.</h3>

For this project, a Seq2Seq model with Embedding and Attention Mechanism was used, which is the backbone of Google Translate. The model learnt how to reply from a dataset of over 48,000 fictional conversations from over 600 movies. For the end product, the Deep Learning model was integrated with WhatsApp and had the ability to reply to messages coming from any source to the user's mobile device.">

The software also stores each update to the project using git and makes it easier to go to any previous state if a problem arises. You can create, organize, manage and contribute to different projects.">

There are different approaches in this field, this project is based on the binary motion image and deep learning approach. Currently, this project classifies eight different human activities - walking, running, jogging, galloping sideways, jumping horizontally, one hand wave, two hand wave and bending. These activities fall into two categories, the first one is the one which is completely dynamic and the second one is somewhat less dynamic, in the sense that there is no motion of the entire body.">

'Do I have attendance so that I can leave my class for sleep? Do I have 75% attendance to appear for exams?' OnTime will now take care of it. It will remember student's classes time table, notify their low attendance, classes needed to be attended to get 75%, classes that they can leave and much more. They will only have to enter their time table of classes once and mark the classes they attended on the app. It will take care of the rest. No need to worry when will the ERP gets updated because they can now maintain their own record of attendance. Maintaining the attendance would get easier and one burden they would get relief of college life as there are many to carry.">

One cannot speak and if he uses sign language,the other cannot see...so our aim is to provide a way of communication between them,it is not limited to this,it also helps in having the conversation with the one who doesn't understand sign language...So for this we have used Kaggle asl dataset and built a model using cnn to give voice to the sign language. This is a team project of three members namely Sourav Jain,Simardeep Singh and Parag Mittal.The link for the dataset used for this is "https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet"">
