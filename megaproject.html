                projects were from various domains like programming, robotics, graphics designing, etc.
                The best projects were given certificates and goodies to appreciate their efforts and encourage them.</h3>

They will only have to enter their time table of classes once and mark the classes they attended on the app. It will take care of the rest. No need to worry when will the ERP gets updated because they can now maintain their own record of attendance. Maintaining the attendance would get easier and one burden they would get relief of college life as there are many to carry.">

One cannot speak and if he uses sign language,the other cannot see...so our aim is to provide a way of communication between them,it is not limited to this,it also helps in having the conversation with the one who doesn't understand sign language...So for this we have used Kaggle asl dataset and built a model using cnn to give voice to the sign language.
